        <p class="p1">You might say Taylor Swift's happy place is at the piano in her Nashville home. "There have been
            so many
            songs that were written at this piano," she said.</p>
        <p class="p1"> "And it's often the middle of the night?" asked correspondent Tracy Smith.</p>
        <p class="p1"> "It's usually in the middle of the night," she replied. "Or if I'm trying to get to sleep and I
            can't
            and
            then I get an idea. And I'm, like, 'Well, I'm not tired anyway!' And then kind of wander over here."</p>
        <p class="p1">It's kind of a rare sight, not just because "Sunday Morning" was there ("I haven't serenaded
            someone in a
            while, hope you know that!"), but because, for the moment, Taylor Swift was actually sitting still.</p>
        <p class="p1 lyrics">I promise that you'll never find another like Me-e-e,<br>
            Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
            I'm the only one of me<br>
            Baby, that's the fun of me<br>
            – "Me!" by Taylor Swift, Joel Little and Brendon Urie<br></p>
        <p class="p1">And there never really has been another like Taylor Swift. After only 13 years in the business,
            she's
            become
            a musical force of nature, with an armload of #1 hits, more Grammy Awards than The Rolling Stones, and
            (according to Forbes) the distinction of being the highest-paid celebrity on the planet.</p>
        <p class="p1">By any measure, she's an amazing young woman. But there were times, she says, that being young,
            and a
            woman,
            worked against her.</p>
        <p class="p1">"You're always gonna have people going, 'Did she write all her own songs?'" she said. "Talking
            about your
            personal life, talking about your dating life.</p>
        <p class="p1">"There's a different vocabulary for men and women in the music industry, right?"</p>
        <p class="p1">"Gimme an example," asked correspondent Tracy Smith.</p>
        <p class="p1">"Okay. A man does something, it's 'strategic'; a woman does the same thing, it's 'calculated.' A
            man is
            allowed to 'react'; a woman can only 'over-react.'"</p>
        <p class="p1">And it seems her usual reaction is to get to work. Swift writes or co-writes all of her songs. And
            what's
            more, her music videos are all her vision, from the pastel wonderland in "Me!"…to the giant dollhouse in
            her latest video, "Lover."</p>
        <p class="p1">That's also the title of her critically-acclaimed new studio album, her seventh. She wrote "Lover"
            on her
            piano at home, and polished it up in the studio. And once she recorded the music, Swift (accompanied by
            and her cats) went to Hollywood to make the music video, and she invited Smith along to watch.</p>
        <p class="p1">There's a love story here, and like a lot of Swift's work, it's an echo of her real life.</p>
        <p class="p1">Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift discovered her love for music as a toddler. She set her
            sights on a
            career in country music, and eventually her parents and younger brother moved to Nashville to help her
            do it.</p>
        <p class="p1">"My brother's a real bro for doing that," Swift said.</p>
        <p class="p1">"Yeah, they all upended their lives," Smith said.</p>
        <p class="p1">"For sure."</p>
        <p class="p1">"It worked out well!"</p>
        <p class="p1">"Yeah, I buy 'em lots of presents," she laughed.</p>
        <p class="p1">The rest reads like a fantasy: Swift became a country music phenomenon, and, in the last few
            years, a pop
            icon. But the superstar is, by her own admission, as emotionally fragile as any other 20-something, "I'm
            still someone who is the first to apologize when I'm wrong," she said. "But I think I'm better at
            standing
            up for myself when I've been wronged. So, that's something that I think also comes with growing up."</p>
        <p class="p1">Which brings us to Scooter Braun. Earlier this summer, Braun, a talent agent with whom Swift says
            she has
            a
            contentious relationship, acquired the rights to her previous recordings – her masters – when his
            company
            bought Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Label Group for a reported $300 million. Borchetta, who worked with
            Swift for years, says she and those close to her (including her dad, who was an investor), knew about
            the
            deal in advance, and that Swift had previously been offered the chance to buy her own masters.</p>
        <p class="p1">She remembers it differently, and told Smith she didn't see it coming: "I found out when it was
            online,
            like,
            when it hit the news."</p>
        <p class="p1">"Nobody in your inner circle knew?" Smith asked.,</p>

            <figcaption class="note align">Taylor talking about Scooter Braun</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="p2">"Nobody knew."</p>
        <p class="p2">"And you didn't smell it?"</p>
        <p class="p2">"No. I knew he would sell my music; I knew he would do that. I couldn't believe who he sold it to,
            because
            we've had endless conversations about Scooter Braun. And he has 300 million reasons to conveniently
            forget
            those conversations."</p>
        <p class="p2">With the sale of the masters to her first six albums, there has been speculation that Swift might
            re-record
            her back catalog, in order to control the recordings of her songs.</p>
        <p class="p2">Smith asked, "Might you do that?"</p>
        <p class="p2">"Oh, yeah," Swift replied.</p>
        <p class="p2">"That's a plan?"</p>
        <p class="p2">"Yeah, absolutely!"</p>
        <p class="p2">Scooter Braun may not agree with her side of the story, but he did reach out to Swift in a tweet
            last
            week,
            calling her new album "brilliant."</p>
        <p class="p2">It's clear that Swift wants to control her music: When it's time to release one of her new songs,
            she
            does it personally, talking to her fans live on Instagram. This personal connection has earned her a
            loyal following. But her openness comes at price: She's followed just about everywhere she goes these
            days, by people who are crazy about her – or just plain crazy.</p>
